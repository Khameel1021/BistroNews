<article><h2>Low and Slow</h2></article>
posted by BGB, November 15, 2016
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cookingtechnique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i>cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into awater bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the
food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, JeffPotter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with DillHollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before<time datetime="20161130">November 30</time>.</p>
